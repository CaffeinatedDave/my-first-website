# my-first-website

As part of [https://codingweek.org/](https://codingweek.org/) you will try to create your first website. This repo will get you started building your own website using GitHub pages.

What you will need: 
* To get set up, first you will need a GitHub account, so register [here](https://github.com/join) or login

* Get git on your machine [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and set it up for the first time [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup). For more info about git try [here](https://try.github.io/) or warch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkUdhyuRHws)

* Download a code editor: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

* Think of your website structure â€“ what do you want to convey, what pages might it might have

* Then click the Fork button at the top of this page.

This creates your very own copy (or repository) of the site in your own area, where you can do whatever you like with it.

You will need to find your own version of the repo, this will be at `https://github.com/<your_username>/my-first-website` - go into settings, and change the Repository name to `<your_username>.github.io` to enable GitHub Pages publishing. Then you can go back to the code and alter it, either by checking it out to your [own machine](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/), or by using GitHub's own code editor.

### How do I customise this (quick version)

There is no limit to what you can do with this site - it is yours to do what you want with. Some ideas are:

* Change the CSS to make it look different to this base style. The file for that is in /css/website.css
* Add more pages (don't forget to link to them in the menu) of extra content.
* Add images (try [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/)* for some free images you can use) and other content, play with the individual page content to test out [all the different HTML tags](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/)*

### I want my own URL, not a github one

You can do that too! I recommend [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)* for their prices and simple ability to customise where the site points to, but any domain name provider should be able to do this.

If you use nameCheap, their guide is a pretty good way to get your domain pointing to the right place.  [https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages]

### What next?

Anything you can imagine: You can build on this site to turn it into your own portfolio, advertise a business, etc.
